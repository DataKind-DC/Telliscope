## Shiny App for Visualizing Imports and Exports of Ethiopia

This folder contains app.py, which if run with Shiny (an R library) will render an interactive visualization of imports and exports in and out of Ethiopia.

A running version of the map is hosted here: https://colorlace.shinyapps.io/single_page_shiny_app/
